Have you ever thought that Hollywood is making a movie on every historical figure they can possibly think of? You wouldn't be alone. That sentiment fueled the idea behind this project. In this data science tutorial and examination, I walk through ETL, EDA, and model creation for 3 separate datasets. The final model serves as an accurate predictor for whether or not a biopic on a given historical figure will have an above-average rating.
